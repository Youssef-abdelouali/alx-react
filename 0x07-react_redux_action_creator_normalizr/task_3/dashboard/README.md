Getting Started with Create React App
This project has been initialized using Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
This command starts the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more information about running tests, refer to the relevant section.

npm run build
This command builds the application for production and outputs it to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for maximum performance.
The build is minified, and the filenames contain hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment!

For additional details, see the deployment section.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation; once you eject, you cannot revert this action!
If you are not satisfied with the build tool or configuration options, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you complete control over them. All commands except eject will still work but will now refer to the copied scripts, allowing you to modify them as needed. At this point, you take full responsibility for managing your configuration.

You are not required to use the eject option. The curated feature set is adequate for small to medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel compelled to utilize this feature unless you wish to customize it further.
